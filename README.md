## **About the Project**

This is a Laravel-based application designed to manage [insert purpose here, e.g., "user authentication," "data processing," or "API handling."]. The project includes features like authentication with JWT, RESTful API endpoints, and integration with MySQL.

---

## **Features**
- Authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.
- Role-based user management (e.g., admin, user, etc.).
- RESTful API endpoints.
- MySQL database for persistent storage.
- Database queue connection using Laravel's built-in queues.
- API documentation provided via **Postman** export.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Before setting up the project, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- **PHP** (version 8.2 or higher)
- **Composer** (dependency manager for PHP)
- **Node.js** and **npm** (for asset compiling)
- **MySQL** (or supported database like PostgreSQL)
- **Laravel Installer** (optional but convenient)

---

## **Installation**

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
cd <repository-name>
```

### 2. Install Composer Dependencies
```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Install JavaScript/Frontend Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Set Environment Variables
- Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example`:
  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
- Configure your database settings in the `.env` file:
  ```env
  DB_CONNECTION=mysql
  DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
  DB_PORT=3306
  DB_DATABASE=your-database-name
  DB_USERNAME=your-username
  DB_PASSWORD=your-password
  ```

- If you are using **JWT**, ensure a `JWT_SECRET` is set. You can generate it with:
  ```bash
  php artisan jwt:secret
  ```

### 5. Run Database Migrations
To create the necessary tables in your database and seed initial data (if applicable):
```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

### 6. Start the Local Development Server
```bash
php artisan serve
```
The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 7. (Optional) Compile Assets
If your project includes JavaScript or CSS using Laravel Vite, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## **Usage**

- Use API testing tools like **Postman** or **Insomnia** to interact with the available endpoints.
- Protected API routes require a **JWT Token** for authentication. Tokens can be obtained by logging in via the appropriate endpoint (e.g., `/api/auth/login`).
- Include the token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>` to access protected routes.

---

## **API Documentation**

The API documentation is provided as a Postman collection. You can import this collection into Postman and test the API.

### Steps to Import the Postman Collection:
1. Open Postman.
2. Click on the **Import** button in the top-left corner.
3. Select the exported Postman collection file (`<your-collection-name>.json`) included in this repository under the `docs/` folder.
4. Once imported, you will see the collection in your Postman workspace, which contains all the API endpoints.

You can find the export file here:
- Path: `/docs/api-collection.json`

If you're hosting the Postman collection on a public URL (like Postman Cloud), you could also add a link:
[View API Documentation on Postman](<insert-shared-link-here>)

---

## **Testing**

Run the test suite to ensure the application is functioning correctly:

1. **Run Tests with PHPUnit:**
   ```bash
   php artisan test
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   vendor/bin/phpunit
   ```

2. Test coverage includes:
    - Feature tests for API endpoints.
    - Unit tests for core functionalities.
